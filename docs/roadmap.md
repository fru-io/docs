## Roadmap

### Current

MVP Feedback 

As you get to know our systems and workflows, we recognize that there might be some places that are a little rough around the edges. We are committed to addressing these issues as soon as they are reported to us. So please, let us know!

A well deserved break

Work life balance has been and is very important to us. But we have been working hard to deliver MVP and we have been burning the candle from both ends a little. So we plan on slowing down a bit to give everyone some time to catch up but we’ll still have the lights on for you.


### Next

Billing and entitlements

You should only be paying for exactly the things you’re using, we need manage our inventory, and be able to do things like regularly bill a credit card. (Who knew!) But.. if you want to pay to use our platform now, we can facilitate that too, [just get in touch](https://dash.ddev.com/docs/support/)!

Expanding the list of CMSes and frameworks

TYPO3, Static sites (Gatsby, Hugo, Jekyll, etc), WordPress, NodeJS, Ruby on Rails --  just to name a few. We also want to [hear from you](https://dash.ddev.com/feedback/) about your portfolio of sites and their requirements.


### Later

More Git hosting providers

We are guessing that many of you have repos hosted in places like GitLab, BitBucket, and Gogs and we don’t want to lock you into just using GitHub.

Tooling unification

We want the transition from local to live to be as smooth as possible, so we need to make some bolts and nuts changes to software versions, images, configuration files.
