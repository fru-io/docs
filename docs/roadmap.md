## Roadmap

### Current

MVP Feedback 

As you get to know our systems and workflows, we recognize that there might be some places that are a little rough around the edges. We are committed to addressing these issues as soon as they are reported to us. So please, let us know!


### Next

Billing and entitlements

You should only be paying for exactly the things you’re using, we need manage our inventory, and be able to do things like regularly bill a credit card. (Who knew!) But.. if you want to pay to use our platform now, we can facilitate that too, [just get in touch](https://docs.ddev.com/support/)!

Expanding the list of CMSs and frameworks

TYPO3, static [sites](sites.md) (Gatsby, Hugo, Jekyll, etc), WordPress, NodeJS, Ruby on Rails --  just to name a few. We also want to [hear from you](https://dash.ddev.com/feedback/) about your portfolio of [sites](sites.md) and their requirements.


### Later

More Git hosting [providers](providers.md)

We are guessing that many of you have repos hosted in places like GitLab, BitBucket, and Gogs and we don’t want to lock you into just using [GitHub](github.md).

Tooling unification

We want the transition from local to live to be as smooth as possible, so we need to make some bolts and nuts changes to software versions, images, configuration files.
