# Roadmap

[Read about recent releases on our blog](https://www.ddev.com/tag/platform-updates/).

## Current
### Unifying the experience when connecting to various Git providers
DDEV-Live as a platform currently supports connections to [GitHub](github.md) and [GitLab](gitlab.md). Both can be referenced in commands if you use the ddev-live CLI. If you use the UI on dash.ddev.com to create a new site then only GitHub is currently available. UI support for GitLab is in progress now. In the future, we'll have more [provider](providers.md) agnostic commands.

### Tooling unification
We want the transition from local to live to be as smooth as possible. To this end, you may currently use the [DDEV-Local integration](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/providers/DDEV-Live/), as well as following the guided stepper in the [dash.ddev.com](https://dash.ddev.com/) UI. 

Additional integrated support is coming soon, and in the meantime we'd love to [hear from you](support.md) about what you expect from that experience!

### Billing and sign up
We're currently making it even easier for you to start a trial account on DDEV-Live. At the moment the signup process requests your GitHub username and a credit card to get started. Changes to this process are rolling out in Spring 2021. If you're eager to get going, want to make a special request, or have a different need from what the [listed plans](https://www.ddev.com/pricing/) allow for, please [email us](mailto:support@ddev.com).

## Next
Fine tuning! We've reached a nice plateau and want to make everything runs smoothly before adding additional features. 

## Later
Expanding the list of supported CMSs and frameworks. Offering fine-grained permissions support for various user roles. 

We also want to [hear from you](https://dash.ddev.com/feedback/) about your portfolio of [sites](sites.md) and their requirements. The most important part of the platform is you; please do start a conversation with us anywhere, anytime :)
