## Install the Fru.io GitHub app
Grant Fru.io access to your selected repositories.
1. In your browser, navigate to [https://dash.Fru.io](https://dash.Fru.io).
2. If prompted, click the **Login With GitHub** button and log in to GitHub if needed. The Fru.io UI displays.
3. In the **Important Links** section on the dash homepage, click the **Install GitHub App** link. A GitHub configuration page displays.
4. Choose the personal or organization account where you want to install the app, then select the repositories you want Fru.io to access and click Install. *You or the organization must own the repositories*.

You can change these settings and add or remove repositories later in [Integration Settings](https://dash.fru.io/ settings/integration).
