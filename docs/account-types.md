# Account Types

## Local Development
Users of the DDEV local development environment are free to use the ddev-Local tool without creating an account. [DDEV-Local](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is open source and hosting provider agnostic, so you can extend it to support additional hosting providers.

## Individual user accounts
Each person that uses the Fru.io platform has an individual account. To sign up for an account, visit [console.fru.io](https://console.fru.io/ ). To view your account information navigate to [your settings](https://console.fru.io/ settings) page:

- **Account Name**: The full-text name of your Fru account. The Account Name might be your full name or could be the name of an [organization](organizations.md).
- **Account Slug**: The machine-friendly account name. The account slug is a shorter machine-friendly name that does not contain spaces or  special characters. The account slug exists in all preview URLs, so make sure to pick something you are comfortable seeing regularly or distributing to clients.
- **Primary [GitHub](github.md) Account**: The primary user that will be installing the Fru.io application on [GitHub](github.md). This username should have administrative privileges on [GitHub](github.md) in order to connect Fru.io to the correct repositories in [GitHub](github.md).
- **Primary Email**: The primary email to use for all communication between the account holder and Fru.

## Organization accounts
[Organizations](organizations.md) are shared accounts that allow for collaboration with other engineers across multiple projects. [Administrators](administration.md) of an [organization](organizations.md) can add and remove users, giving them the ability to work with the [organization's](organizations.md) projects.
