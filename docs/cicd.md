# CI/CD and Fru-Live

In addition to serving as a hosting platform, Fru.io can be used as a step in your CI/CD workflow. Using the [Fru.io CLI](https://docs.fru.io/ getting-started/#install-the-Fru-live-cli) and [API Token](https://docs.fru.io/ authentication/#authenticating-with-a-token), you may connect to Fru.io from the CI/CD tools of your preference. Fru-Live's use of [Git providers](https://docs.fru.io/ providers/) also allows the platform to integrate with a GitOps workflow. 

We've included a few tutorials as examples: 

- [CircleCI](https://docs.fru.io/ circleci/)
- [Jenkins](https://docs.fru.io/ jenkins/)
