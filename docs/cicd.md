# CI/CD and DDEV-Live
In addition to serving as a hosting platform, DDEV-Live can be used as a step in your CI/CD workflow. Using the [DDEV-Live CLI](https://docs.ddev.com/getting-started/#install-the-ddev-live-cli) and [API Token](https://docs.ddev.com/authentication/#authenticating-with-a-token), you may connect to DDEV-Live from the CI/CD tools of your preference. We've included a few tutorials as examples: 
- [CircleCI](https://docs.ddev.com/circleci/)
- [Jenkins](https://docs.ddev.com/jenkins/)
