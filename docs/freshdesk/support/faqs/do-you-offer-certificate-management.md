Yes, certificate management is included via LetsEncrypt for all hostnames associated with your environment(s).

Sites can either have TLS turned on or off. If off, we will only ever serve the site on http (https URLs will not work). If TLS is turned on, we only serve redirects on HTTP to HTTPS.

For more about HTTPS on DDEV-LIVE, please see this [Support policy page](<https://support.drud.com/support/solutions/articles/36000069971-https-on-ddev-live>).
