# Providers

In DDEV-Live, a provider is an upstream Git repository provider like [GitHub](github.md), GitLab, or Bitbucket. Providers are a pluggable part of our system and we are working to expand the list of supported providers on a regular basis to enable your GitOps workflows. At this time, we have a mature provider relationship with [GitHub](github.md). The first integrations with GitLab are scheduled to come online in the second quarter of 2020.
