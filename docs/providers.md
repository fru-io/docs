# Providers

In DDEV-Live, a provider is an upstream Git repository provider like [GitHub](github.md), [GitLab](gitlab.md), or Bitbucket. Providers are a pluggable part of our system and we are working to expand the list of supported providers on a regular basis to enable your GitOps workflows. At this time, we have a mature provider relationship with [GitHub](github.md) and self-managed [GitLab Omnibus](gitlab.md). [GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/) may be used in the same way, however you will need to [manually configure webhooks](https://docs.ddev.com/gitlab/#project-webhook-configuration).
