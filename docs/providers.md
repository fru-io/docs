# Providers

In DDEV-Live, a provider is an upstream git repository provider like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. Providers are a pluggable part of the system and we are expanding the list of supported providers on a regular basis. At this time, we have a mature provider relationship with GitHub. The first integrations with GitLab are scheduled to come online in the second quarter of 2020.
