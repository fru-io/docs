# Get started with DDEV-Live

This tutorial will step you through setting up DDEV-Live as an early access user - from initial account authentication to publishing a website on a pre-production URL.

This tutorial uses Drupal as an example. DDEV-Live will generally support other PHP applications and CMSs such as TYPO3.

### Steps in the process:
* [Install the DDEV-Live GitHub App on your GitHub account](#install-the-ddev-live-github-app)
* [Install the DDEV-Live CLI on your machine](#install-the-ddev-live-cli)
* [Verify and Authenticate](#verify-installation-and-authenticate)
* [Add a site from your connected GitHub repo](#add-a-site-from-your-connected-github-account)
* [Import a database and files](#import-a-database-and-files)
* [Work with your site on DDEV-Live](#working-with-your-site-on-ddev-live)

### You will need
* An email from the DDEV team inviting you to access the platform and giving you a personal `<org>` to use in commands below.
* Current, up-to-date operating system (macOS, Linux or Windows).
* Internet connection.
* GitHub account.
* GitHub repository containing a Drupal 7 or 8 project to import for this tutorial.
* Export in archive format of your [database](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/cli-usage/#exporting-a-database "DDEV-Local export db"), and...
* Unarchived file directories to upload for your project, if applicable.

## Install the DDEV-Live GitHub app
Grant DDEV-Live access to your selected repositories.
1. In your browser, navigate to [https://dash.ddev.com](https://dash.ddev.com).
2. If prompted, click the **Login With Github** button and log in to GitHub if needed. The DDEV-Live UI displays. (You are likely already viewing this guide in the UI at [https://dash.ddev.com/docs/getting-started/](https://dash.ddev.com/docs/getting-started/)).
3. In the **Important Links** section on the dash homepage, click the **Install Github App** link. A GitHub configuration page displays.
4. Choose the personal or organization account where you want to install the app, then select the repositories you want DDEV-Live to access and click Install. *You or the organization must own the repositories*.

You can change these settings and add or remove repositories later in [Settings](https://dash.ddev.com/settings/).

## Install the DDEV-Live CLI
From the [DDEV-Live dashboard](https://dash.ddev.com), click the **Authenticate via CLI** link for your operating system to download the DDEV-Live CLI. This will download a file named ddev-live.zip.

#### Mac and Linux
1. Extract ddev-live.zip. For example: `unzip ddev-live.zip`.
2. Move the resulting ddev-live binary to a directory that is in your $PATH variable. For example:`mv ~/Downloads/ddev-live /usr/local/bin`. You may need to add to your $PATH in your .bash_profile or equivalent.

#### Windows
1. Extract ddev-live.zip to a directory that is in your %PATH% variable. For example, extract to: `C:\Program Files`. You may need to edit and add to the Path environment variable in Advanced System Properties.

### Verify installation and authenticate
Authentication connects the DDEV-Live platform to the DDEV-Live CLI.
1. In your terminal window, type `ddev-live`. Successful installation will return usage information. Run `ddev-live [command] -h` at any time for details on commands.
2. Run `ddev-live auth`. A browser window opens the DDEV-Live dashboard displaying a confirmation message.
  The CLI displays `Authentication complete!`. If you are primarily working with one organization you may want to run ddev-live auth --default-org <org> to refer to sites only using <site> instead of <org>/<site> and eliminate needing to use the --org <org> flag for subsequent commands.

## Add a site from your connected GitHub account
#### DDEV-Live default settings.
We give additional flags below to use if your project differs from these defaults.
* Default Drupal version is Drupal 8.
* Default docroot is the project root (ie the directory from which your site is served).
* Default branch is master.
* `composer install` will not run.

#### User-provided values in commands:
* `<org>` is the DDEV provided value for your unique organization on DDEV-Live. Please see your "Welcome" email for details.
* `<site>` is what you want to call your project on DDEV-Live. It must consist of lower case alphanumeric characters or ''-'', start with an _alphabetic_ character, and end with an _alphanumeric_ character.
* `<github-org>` is your connected GitHub user or organization.
* `<repo-name>` is the connected repo you want to import.

1. To create your project on DDEV-Live and import code from GitHub with the default settings, run:
```
ddev-live create site drupal <org>/<site> --github-repo <github-org>/<repo-name> [flags]
```

Here is a common example for a Drupal 8 site that requires `composer install`, with the docroot in /web:
```
ddev-live create site drupal my-org/my-site --github-repo my-github/my-repo --docroot web --run-composer-install
```

You can add flags for specific configuration options. Use `ddev-live create site drupal --help` to see all possible flags and their descriptions. A few common flags:

| Flag | Description |
| :---- | :----------- |
| `--drupal-version <version>` |Specify the Drupal version, `<7>` or `<8>`. The default is Drupal 8. |
| `--docroot <path>` |The docroot is the directory from which your site is served. The default is the project root. <br> This value is a relative path from your project root. For Drupal 8, the most common is `--docroot web`. |
| `--run-composer-install` |Runs `composer install` on site creation. <br> The default is that Composer does _not_ run. <br> Further arguments are available with `--composer-args <args>`.|
| `--branch <branch-name>` |Specify the branch of a GitHub repo. The default branch is `master`. |

The CLI will display feedback while your site is being initialized. It may take a few minutes for your site image to be built.  When your site has been successfully created, the CLI displays:
```
Created Drupal site: <org>/<site>
```

2. Type `ddev-live describe site <org>/<site>`
The output will display several sections including status and health. These sections are not populated until the system reports on them, and the status messages change as the system provisions the site. It takes several minutes for all health checks to return "true."

The `Preview URL:` line of the output will display the preview url for your site when it has been created. Visit this link to confirm that your code has been imported. For example, `https://my-site-my-org.sites.ddev.live/`.

## Import a database and files
Upload any existing content for your project using the database export archive and files directory as mentioned in the section ["You will need"](#you-will-need), above. For more on asset backup and restore please see the [FAQs](https://dash.ddev.com/docs/faqs/).

Uploading files or a database will trigger an instance that performs the task on DDEV-Live. Keep an eye out for the instance name that is displayed as your local command finishes. For example, the instance name for `ddev-live push files` will be contained in the line `Initiated files restore: <org>/<site>-<id>`. You can use the instance name in subsequent describe commands to see status.
1. First, upload your database archive to the site environment.
```
ddev-live push db <org>/<site> <path>
```
For example, here is a successful command and response, showing your database restore instance name:
```
ddev-live push db my-org/my-site /tmp/db.sql.gz
Uploaded: /tmp/db.sql.gz
Initiated backup restore: my-org/my-site-8wbmv
```
Use the restore instance to check the status of the restore operation, for example:
```
ddev-live describe restore my-org/my-site-8wbmv
```

2. Next, upload your files to the site environment. Move into your files directory and push the files using:
```
ddev-live push files <org>/<site> .
```
For example, here is a successful command and response for a site with the docroot in web, showing your file restore instance name:
```
cd web/sites/default/files && ddev-live push files my-org/my-site .
Uploaded: [files list]
Initiated files restore: my-org/my-site-t5jn5
```
Use the restore instance to check the status of the file restore operation, for example:
```
ddev-live describe restore my-org/my-site-t5jn5
```

3. Visit or refresh your site's URL in the browser to confirm it is displaying as expected.

## Working with your site on DDEV-Live
The DDEV-Live GitHub app watches the specified branch of your repo. When you push updates to the repo, DDEV-Live will redeploy the site.

* View a list of all the sites within a specified organization with `ddev-live list sites --org <org>`.
* View the state of a specific site with `ddev-live describe site <org>/<site>`.
* Use `ddev-live config` to modify the GitHub repo or branch to pull from.
* Use `ddev-live delete` to delete a resource. For example, `ddev-live delete site <org>/<site>`.
* Use `ddev-live backup` to initiate a database or files backup.
* Use `ddev-live pull` to download project database or files.
