# Welcome Golden Ticket Holder

## What to expect and how you can help
During this process, getting feedback will be critical.  We’ll be counting on you to share feedback in several ways: 
- We want your [feedback on your experience](https://dash.ddev.com/feedback/)
- If you get stuck, [we're here to support you](https://dash.ddev.com/docs/support/)
- We'll reach out during the course of your trial and towards the end, we'll schedule a call. 

## Here’s the areas where feedback will be most valuable: 
### Workflow
- Does our tooling fit into your current workflows?
- Can you launch a new site?
- Can you import an old site?
- Can you create a backup?
- Can you alter a site environment?

### Feedback
- What do you like?
- What do you dislike?
- What did you struggle with?
- Was the documentation helpful?

## But before we begin...
Before we get started, there’s just a couple of items that you’ll need to keep in mind: 

- **No production sites please**: this is not intended as a production-level product at this stage. Think of it as an additional tool connected to your Github account. No credit cards needed, no production workloads or bitcoin mining (no abuse please).
- **21 days**: No - it’s not the name of a movie, starring our beloved DDEV community, it’s the number of days you’ll be able to run the early access preview
- **No domain management**: Since we’re not testing live/production sites, we won’t be handling domain management in this early release preview.  
- **Your next step is the [Getting Started Guide](https://dash.ddev.com/docs/getting-started/)**

## We’re so excited to have you as an early access partner!  
We can’t thank you enough for being on this journey with us, especially as one of the first people to get access to our new hosting platform, DDEV-Live.  We’re excited that you’re a part of this.  

All the best,  
The DDEV Team
