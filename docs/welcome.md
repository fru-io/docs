# Welcome Golden Ticket Holder
What to expect and how you can help. 
During this process, getting feedback will be critical.  We’ll be counting on you to share feedback in several ways: 
Feedback form on the DDEV-Live dashboard support page
Email us at: support@ddev.com
Scheduled Zoom call towards the end of your trial period (we’ll schedule once you’ve gotten started).  

Here’s the areas where feedback will be most valuable: 
Is it a convenient process?  
Is it speedy?  
Is the CLI easy to use?  
Was the workflow more simple to get a site up and running on the platform?  
What was the most challenging aspect of the platform?


But before we begin...
Before we get started, there’s just a couple of items that you’ll need to keep in mind: 

No production sites please: this is not intended as a production-level product at this stage. Think of it as an additional tool connected to your Github account. No credit cards needed, no production workloads or bitcoin mining (no abuse please).
21 days: No - it’s not the name of a movie, starring our beloved DDEV community, it’s the number of days you’ll be able to run the early access preview
No domain management: Since we’re not testing live/production sites, we won’t be handling domain management in this early release preview.
