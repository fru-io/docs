# DDEV Local

!!! note
    If you're looking for the [documentation for DDEV Local](https://ddev.readthedocs.io) it hasn't been merged here yet.

[ddev](https://github.com/drud/ddev) is an open source tool that makes it dead simple to get local PHP development environments up and running within minutes. It's powerful and flexible as a result of its per-project environment configurations, which can be extended, version controlled, and shared. In short, ddev aims to allow development teams to use Docker in their workflow without the complexities of bespoke configuration.

## Integrations
The DDEV Team is planning first-class integrations between DDEV Local and DDEV Live. If you have ideas or want to help us shape our roadmap [get in touch](https://dash.ddev.com/feedback/).
