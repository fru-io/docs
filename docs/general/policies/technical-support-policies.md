Drud Technology delivers technical support services including Problem Resolution Support, Engineering Support and Consultative Support for DDEV, Drud Preview, Drud Hosting and related products via the Customer Slack Channel.

Each designated technical contact will receive a Customer Slack Channel ID based on the associated email address that can be used to report new support issues, monitor ongoing issues or review historical issues.  Information regarding making changes to technical contacts may be submitted via the Customer Slack Channel or via an email request.

All support services are delivered in English.  Drud Tech will use reasonable efforts to provide support in other languages using available personnel but may not have such resources available at the time of the support request.

## Problem Resolution Support

The focus of Problem Resolution Support is helping to restore service and assisting with command syntax, installation, configuration, upgrades and other general product usage topics.

## Engineering Support

Engineering support can include bug fixes, patches, hotfixes, and topics that require communication with the product engineering team.  Hot fixes are provided to address critical failures and may not receive the full QA and regression testing performed on regular maintenance releases due to the urgent nature of the situation.

Custom feature development (Non Recurring Engineering) is a separate service and is not included in Engineering Support

## Consultative Support

Consultative Support covers issues that are specific to a customer's deployment, such as performance tuning, best practice recommendations and code reviews, rather than general product usage, service failures or software defects.  Drud Tech’s Managed Hosting Service is a separate service and is not included in Consultative Support.

Consultative Support is intended for narrow, specific topics and is not a replacement for a dedicated Professional Services engagement which can address systemic, architectural and other broader topics.

### Performance Tuning

Drud Tech will provide assistance resolving performance problems caused by configuration, storage engines, and more, suggesting changes and identifying alternative implementations suited to a particular environment.

###

### CICD Review

Drud Tech can review your CICD process to assist with following best practices and ensuring correctness regarding the various tools, extensions and recommending changes as necessary to support particular needs.

## Issue Severity

Support issues are assigned a Severity level reflecting the impact to production operations. This is set initially by the customer when reporting a new issue and Drud Tech will help to ensure that the issue receives an appropriate rating:

- **Urgent**: Catastrophic problem that severely impacts the ability to conduct business. This means that production systems are down (completely non-responsive or not functioning) and no known workaround exists.

- **High**: High impact problem in which production operations are disrupted but remain somewhat productive or have an available workaround.

- **Medium**: Medium or lower impact problem that involves partial loss of non-critical functionality. This may be a minor issue with limited or no loss of functionality or impact to production operations. This includes administrative requests and errors in product documentation.

- **Low**: Low level problem that does not significantly affect system function or operations. This includes new feature requests.

In some situations, Drud Tech may elect to assign an Urgent or High Severity level for failures on non-production systems based on the overall business impact. Drud Tech may change the severity of an issue based on the guidelines above.

## Telephone Support

For Urgent emergency production outages, customers may request that Drud Tech make contact by telephone. Resolving technical support issues generally requires analysis of system logs and other data that must be transmitted via email and file attachments to the support issue rather than by telephone. Including this information when reporting the support issue dramatically hastens the process of resolving the problem and restoring production functionality.
