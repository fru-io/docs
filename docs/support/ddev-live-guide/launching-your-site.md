# The Launch Process

For sites that are already hosted and live on another platform, we provide a site proxy service to forward traffic to another IP.

We will proxy your live site and restore a copy to DDEV-Live, providing you a preview URL to review it on DDEV Live.

Once you've validated that the production site looks good, let us know that you are ready to migrate to DDEV-Liveâ€™s full hosting mode, and point your DNS at us:

- Apex domain (yoursite.com), include all 3 A-records:
  - A Record: @ | 35.168.185.204
  - A Record: @ | 35.169.15.168
  - A Record: @ | 52.0.29.214

* www subdomain ([www.]("http://www.drupaleasy.com/")yoursite.com):
  - CNAME Record: www | live.drud.com

- subdomain (subdomain.yoursite.com)
  - CNAME Record: subdomain | live.drud.com

We'll:

1.  re-sync your DB and files (if required)
2.  Turn off the site proxy
3.  Add the hostnames to the environment
4.  Turn on TLS

_Note: While LetsEncrypt gets the certificate to us very quickly, there is a delay before the TLS cert is in place and usable (usually less than 10 minutes)._
