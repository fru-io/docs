[DDEV Live](https://www.drud.com/ddev-live/) is fully tested hosting with production-grade container orchestration for autonomous self-healing and horizontally scalable flexibility, with a 99.99% uptime guarantee, service SLAs, backed by a team of industry experts.

DDEV Live runs whatever you give it: anything that you need to run your site is pushed to a GIT endpoint, via a git push. There’s no pre-processing of source code before it gets deployed to an environment.

Our vision for DDEV-Live is deploy _anywhere_: bare metal, public cloud, in-house, or hybrid. From your local machine, to test/QA, to live, DDEV provides a dev-to-deploy workflow that is faster, more efficient, and more reliable.
