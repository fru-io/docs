*There aren't manual steps involved with adeploy/merge to production*. \_As long as all of your dependencies are in the git push, they will get deployed. Settings files will be generated and automatically connected to the DB.

Because the DDEV LIve build process is not complex, you should expect that whatever you push to DDEV Live will get deployed. If there’s a failure in the managed part of the platform, we’ll absolutely take care of it.
