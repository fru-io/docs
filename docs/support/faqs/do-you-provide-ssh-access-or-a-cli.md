No, we do not currently provide SSH access for security reasons.

We currently provide:

- [an API]("https://support.drud.com/support/solutions/articles/36000106931-working-with-the-api")Â to allow clients to access common workflow processes (such as environment sync, backup, and restore)
- a hook system - **@TODO - link to Hook docs**

We will be support

_We are also actively working on a command-line tool that will allow customers to access all functionality exposed to the API._
